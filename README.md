## HI THERE! Please actually read this.##

FONTS. I ran into lots of issues with fonts. The font I pick is Sofia Pro, which is a Adobe TypeKit font. Except that gave me many problems as it would run on my local environment, but not any other computer. Because I failed to add it in with TypeKit and it was already too late (too inconvienient to change the font), I am using a 30 day trial with MyFonts. PLEASE IGNORE THE UGLY TRIAL MESSAGE AND BUTTON. Hopefully, it doesn't interfere.
